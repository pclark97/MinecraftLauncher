MinecraftLauncher
=================

Small little Cocoa app to let my kids run a local minecraft server, without needing access to Terminal.app.

Shows use of NSTask and some synthesized properties in the app delegate.

Significantly, this app does not actually distribute the minecraft server.
You'll need to download the minecraft_server.jar file yourself, from [minecraft.net](http://www.minecraft.net/download "minecraft.net").
